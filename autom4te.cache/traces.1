   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for \'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }\', c99 incorrectly complains
   \'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function\'.
   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.

   Suppress the use of extern inline on problematic Apple configurations.
   OS X 10.8 and earlier mishandle it; see, e.g.,
   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html>.
   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Perhaps Apple will fix this some day.  */
